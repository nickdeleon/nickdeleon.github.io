          <p>Hi there! You've found my website! I created this as a way to show off of skills and proficiency in HTML and CSS. Below you will find some work experience and some of my accomplishments related to those jobs. I think learning HTML and CSS are great skills that would be valuable in any role and feel the need to show my new found knowledge off.                                                                                                                         </p>

        <p>
Through this internship I partnered with buyers to identify risks and opportunities across four different suppliers resulting in better monitored inventory health and more optimized assortment.
Additionally, I conducted bi-weekly business reviews as well weekly recaps of individual outdoor brands. Through out the summer I worked on a project focused on evealuating the health of the Columbia brand. The business review led to finding flaws in the product assortment as well as site navigability.
