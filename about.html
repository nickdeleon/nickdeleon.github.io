        <p>Hi! My name is Nick de Leon and I am currently working at Macy’s in digital merchandising. I’m originally from Wisconsin and attended college at the University of Wisconsin-Madison (Go Badgers!) where I recieved a Bachelor of Science in Economics, Retail & Consumer Behavior. </p>
        <p>I have always been fasinated by the interseciton of technology and business and that is what originally drew me to an exciting carreer in E-commerce. As such I have been working to develop not only business skills, but as well as more technology related skills as well. If you ever want to chat feel free to add me on different social media accounts below, or shoot me an email by clicking the “Contact” link above. </p>
